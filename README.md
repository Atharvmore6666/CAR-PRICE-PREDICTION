# Motivation:
The purpose of this project is to predict car prices based on various features such as engine size, 
fuel type, and body style. Accurate price predictions are essential for manufacturers and consumers 
to make informed decisions in the competitive automotive market.

# Conclusion:
The car price prediction model, built using a linear regression algorithm, effectively estimates car
prices based on key features. It offers insights that can help manufacturers, dealers, and buyers 
make data-driven decisions in pricing vehicles. While the model performs well, there are opportunities
to improve its accuracy by addressing missing data and enhancing the feature engineering process.
